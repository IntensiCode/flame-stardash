development philosophy:

* Short, focused functions.
* Use snake_case for functions, fields and variables.
* Use PascalCase for classes.
* Descriptive names preferred over comments.
* Fail fast: Use assert/fatal, avoid defensive checks.
* Prioritize performance and clarity.
* Iterative refinement of features.
